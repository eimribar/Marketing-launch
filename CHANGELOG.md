## Summary of Current State (v2.0.0)

### What Works
‚úÖ Original Princess UI perfectly preserved  
‚úÖ Marketing content and data integrated  
‚úÖ Timeline shows 15 marketing tasks  
‚úÖ localStorage persistence  
‚úÖ Vercel deployment  

### What Was Learned
1. **UI Consistency is Critical** - Users want exact replica of original design
2. **Content Over Chrome** - Focus on data changes, not visual changes
3. **Data Structure Matters** - Phase/category matching essential for timeline
4. **Version Control Helps** - Force refresh prevents stale data issues

### Known Limitations
- Single-user only (localStorage based)
- No real-time collaboration
- Limited to 15 tasks in current view
- Budget/KPI features removed (can be added as separate pages)
